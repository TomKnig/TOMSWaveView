TOMSWaveView
============

A siri like visualization of a single numeric input.

## Installation with CocoaPods

TOMSWaveView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod "TOMSWaveView"
```

## Usage

Instantiate TOMSWaveView as you would do with an UIView.

```objective-c
TOMSWaveView *waveView = [[TOMSWaveView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 42, aView.frame.size.width, 42)];
[aView addSubview:waveView];
```

Set the `dataSource` property of the `waveView` to an object, that adopts `TOMSWaveViewDataSource`.

```objective-c
@interface ... () <TOMSWaveViewDataSource>
```

Implement `-(float)valueForWaveView:(TOMSWaveView *)waveView` within that object.

```objective-c
#pragma mark - TOMSWaveViewDataSource

- (float)valueForWaveView:(id)waveView
{
    return 0; //return your constantly changing value here
}
```

## Customization

TOMSWaveView provides the possibility to configure the look and feel.
The configureable properties will be documented in future.
